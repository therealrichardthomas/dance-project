Project Title: Dance Academy
Project Description: This project uses PUG, Node.js, Express, and CSS to create a fake dance academy website practicing these skills. I was learning how to use PUG for the first time through this project along with using Node.js and Express to implement its features. In this project, I learned how to use PUG inheritance, create a localhost server, and retrieving data from other files (e.g. retrieving the Contact Page). 

Project Technologies Used:
  - PUG: PUG is a template enginer that simplifies writing HTML code (learned PUG inheritance and basic PUG syntax)
  - Node.js: to create server-side applications within the localhost
  - Express.js: works with Node.js to simplify handling server requests

Installation Instructions: 
  - run https://therealrichardthomas.github.io/dance-project/views/index.html in the browser

*Notes*
  - I used PUG as the main HTML file for this project; however, GitHub can only run on static views and through an index.html file in the root page. So I created new HTML files that were relevant to the project by converting the PUG files to HTML and placed them in the corresponding directories. Since GitHub uses an index.html file in the root directory, I also created another index.html file in the root that redirects to the index.html in the views folder that contains the entire project.
